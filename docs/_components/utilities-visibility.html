title: "Visibility"
description: |
  <p>The visibility utility classes will produce different visibility and hidden effects on the elements they are applied to.  In the first row of <code>span</code> tags we have the class <code>.evo_h-utilities__visibility--hidden</code> for the <code>span</code> containing the content <code>4</code>.  This class removes the element entirely from the DOM and its dimensions are no longer respected by the surrounding <code>span</code>s.  In the second <code>span</code> row, the class <code>.evo_h-utilities__visibility--invisible</code> is applied to the <code>4</code> <code>span</code>.  In this case, the visibility of this element is hidden from the user however its DOM dimensions are respected by the surrounding <code>span</code> tags this time.  It is as if the elements opacity was turned down to 0.</p>
